#### Famous Films That everyone wants to have watched (but no one wants to watch ...)

+ _Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959)_
An enchanting tail of a young couple who finally discover each other during a noisy summer of hopes, dreams and unusual failures. Nah; Just kidding. Plan 9 from Outer Space is a 1957 American independent science fiction-horror film produced, written, directed, and edited by Ed Wood. The film was shot in black-and-white in November 1956 and had a theatrical preview screening on March 15, 1957, at the Carlton Theatre in Los Angeles (the onscreen title at this time read Grave Robbers from Outer Space). It went into general release on July 22, 1959, in Texas and several other southern states re-titled Plan 9 from Outer Space, before being sold to television in 1961.
