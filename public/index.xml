Table of contents  Overview Mechanism Commands Output References Evolution  Overview Sentiment analysis is the semantic study of emotion in language. This form of analysis is used to determine the level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction in textual data such as reviews, survey responses, online and social media posting and similar. Due to the often high volume of feedback from the above types of textual data, sentiment analysis provides an automated solution for determining the &amp;ldquo;feeling&amp;rdquo; of the text.</description>

      <description>CMPSC-300-00: Bioinformatics (4 Credits) Academic Bulletin Description An introduction to the development and application of methods, from the computational and information sciences, for the investigation of biological phenomena. In this interdisciplinary course, students integrate computational techniques with biological knowledge to develop and use analytical tools for extracting, organizing, and interpreting information from genetic sequence data. Often participating in team-based and hands-on activities, students implement and apply useful bioinformatics algorithms. During a weekly laboratory session students employ cutting-edge software tools and programming environments to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.</description>

      <description>CMPSC-301-00: Data Analytics Academic Bulletin Description An introduction to computational and analytical methods for finding patterns in large data sets. Using statistical procedures that they design and implement in programming environments, students extract knowledge from financial, political, scientific, and other data sources, exploring the issues of power and privilege that emerge from their discoveries. Students also learn to contrast their own perspectives with the ones identified by their analyses, reflecting on the ethical consequences of using the power that originates from computationally derived knowledge.</description>

      <description>CMPSC-580-00: Junior Seminar Academic Bulletin Description A team-based investigation of select topics in computer science, preparing students for the proposal and completion of a senior project. Working in teams to complete hands-on activities, students learn how to read research papers, state and motivate research questions, design and conduct experiments, and collect and organize evidence for evaluating scientific hypotheses. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to gain practical skills in scientific and technical writing, the presentation of computational and mathematical concepts, and the visualization of experimental data.</description>

      <description>Abstract It is necessary to update the pedagogy in CS to produce computer scientists who are able to think holistically in the design and development of novel technologies which cater to more humanitarian interests. Allegheny’s Department of Computer Science, working in tandem with other schools and partners, aims to develop and integrate responsible thinking into the curricula and the technical aspects of its CS courses. This serves to inspire students, and results in the creation of open source projects, activities, programs and associated media in which responsible thinking plays a larger role in the technology.</description>

      <description>Abstract Interaction between genes is one driving force that can influence a biological outcome. In a genetic disease such as cancer, understanding genetic interactions may help us elucidate mechanisms sustaining cancer growth. A computational approach is one way to detect genetic interactions in the context of cancer. In this article, we introduce a tool, GenExSt, and its underlying method to study gene interactions. We applied our method to discover gene-pairs whose expressions demonstrate patterns of correlation.</description>

      <description>Abstract Investigators in bioinformatics are often confronted with the difficult task of connecting ideas, which are found scattered around the literature, using robust keyword searches. It is often customary to identify only a few keywords in a research article to facilitate search algorithms, which is usually completed in absence of a general approach that would serve to index all possible keywords of an article’s characteristic attributes. Based on only a hand-full of keywords, articles are therefore prioritized by search algorithms that point investigators to seeming subsets of their knowledge.</description>

      <description>Abstract After synthesis, a protein is still immature until it has been customized for a specific task. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are steps in biosynthesis to perform this customization of protein for unique functionalities. PTMs are also important to protein survival because they rapidly enable protein adaptation to environmental stress factors by conformation change. The overarching contribution of this thesis is the construction of a computational profiling framework for the study of biological signals stemming from PTMs associated with stressed proteins.</description>
